                        Enchanting crystal-clear waters protected by a coral reef, with white sandy beaches that stretch hundreds of kilometers: This is <strong>Watamu Island</strong> an old fishing village on the Indian Ocean, in southeast Kenya. Watamu is located around 100km (62 miles) up the coast from Kenya&rsquo;s second city, <strong>Mombasa and Watamu </strong>has long been known for its rich Swahili culture and its history. Now it&rsquo;s also known as one of Kenya most impressive beach vacation spots, and an incredible water sports haven that attracts celebrity milliners, billionaires&rsquo; actors, and wealthy of the wealthiest. The trade winds that blow in the afternoons make it ideal for <strong>windsurfing </strong>and <strong>kitesurfing</strong>, while<strong> paddleboarders</strong> have the chance to get close to the many species of <strong>dolphin and shacks </strong>that swim in the ocean. Watamu Beach&rsquo;s crystal-clear waters make it an excellent location for<strong> snorkeling </strong>and<strong> diving</strong>, and the surrounding area is home to an abundance of wildlife. The shoreline in the area features white sand beaches and offshore coral formations arranged in different bays and beaches: Garoda Beach, Turtle Bay, Blue Lagoon Bay, Watamu Bay, Ocean breeze, and Kanani reef and Jacaranda beach. They are protected as part of the <strong>Watamu Marine National Park</strong>. The Marine Park is considered one of the best snorkeling and diving areas on the coast of East Africa. It is also rated the third-best beach in Africa, for its crystal-clear water and silver sand beaches. In order to assist the managing authorities namely Kenyan Wildlife Service, in protecting the Park, local community groups, the tourist sector and environmental groups have formed a unique organization <strong>Watamu Marine Association</strong>. Members of this group are Turtle Bay, Hemingways, Ocean Sports, Arocha Kenya, Lonno Lodge, Mida Community Conservation group, Watamu Boat Operator, Safari Sellers and women's group. The ruins of Gedi (also known as Gede) are located near Watamu. <strong>The Watamu Marine National Park</strong> is located around 1km off the coast of Watamu Beach, and it contains <strong>600 fish species</strong>, 110 species of stony coral, and countless invertebrates, crustaceans and molluscs. Watamu has a strong population of <strong>Italian expats</strong> who have left their mark on the local cuisine via authentic Italian pizza and ice cream. Watamu is a cosmopolitan town which blends Kenyan, Arab, and Italian influences. Watamu Beach is a popular post beach holiday getaway for travelers who want to unwind. If you have a strict itinerary and want to see everything that Kenya has to offer, then we recommend that you spend a few days in Watamu.

It takes around 4 hours to drive from Diani to Watamu, but you can reduce the journey time to 1.5 hours by taking a 15-minute flight from Ukunda to Vipingo and then finishing your journey with a 1 hour 20-minute taxi journey from <strong>Vipingo from Watamu</strong>. Watamu is on the North Coast of Kenya, a stretch of coastline which spans from Nyali to Malindi. The road journey from Mombasa is slightly longer and the drive will take around two hours. The taxi journey will cost up to Usd 100 although it is possible to drive from Nairobi, the long road journey takes around 8 hours, so we recommend that you fly to Malindi or Mombasa to shorten the journey time.

                    <p class="short-content" style="text-align:justify;">
                        According to archaeological findings, Watamu is said to have been inhabited from as far back as the 13th Century. The famous Gedi ruins is an indication of life in Watamu in those eras as the Gedi people&rsquo;s sea port was in the <strong>Mida creek</strong> at a deep-water place called Sita.

                        According to archaeological findings, Watamu is said to have been inhabited from as far back as the 13th Century. The famous Gedi ruins is an indication of life in Watamu in those eras as the Gedi people&rsquo;s sea port was in the <strong>Mida creek</strong> at a deep-water place called Sita. with ruins of big mosques in Kirepwe Island and Temple Point areas that are estimated to be abandoned at least 600 years ago. The current modern Watamu has a young history that can be traced from 1937 when an Irish family, the Flynns, shipwrecked around Watamu and were washed ashore in the beach at Turtle Bay and lived in an overturned boat. By then Watamu was just a forest with no population except for the occasional fishermen from Malindi and Lamu (the Bajuni/Swahili) who swam to the shore once in a while when the sea was rough to shelter in thatched shacks, north of the beach currently near Watamu village's position. The existing development started around 1950-1960 when the then colonial Government cut out 50 beachfront plots and started leasing them out to mostly the white settlers of Kenya and any international visitors interested. This gave Watamu its allure as the holiday destination of choice. The plots line up from where now is Blue bay up to the mouth of the Mida Creek. The indigenous people of Kenya were also included when the then Government also developed the Gede settlement scheme that covers Gede, Jimba, Dabaso areas and allowed the Mijikenda to buy and settle. Bajuni fishermen families also started settling in the Watamu Village as the British government blasted a small part of the reef to provide the gateway (Mlango) for boats to dock closer to the shore while protected by the reefs in the era during or before the 2nd World War. This is because of Watamu having a large coral garden and abundant fish for this community with its main economic activity being fishing and having a ready market in the holiday makers in the beach plots. The first hotel to be in Watamu was the Ocean Sports that started as a beach bar, (built at the same location where the first Irish family found themselves) in Turtle Bay, built by Ian Pritchard who landed there in 1951. The bar was subsequently developed into a hotel and was the first centre for water sports. The 2nd complete hotel with full rooms was the Watamu Beach Hotel built overlooking Watamu Bay. <br /> The combination of these 3 communities with their different culture and economic activities is what gave birth to Watamu as a top holiday destination up to date, and rich bio-diverse marine

                                Watamu has two rainy seasons &ndash; a short rainy season in November and December and a long rainy season from April through June which starts sprinkles by end of March, with May being considered the wettest month. During the long rainy season, heavy downpours are expected in the afternoon in comparison to less frequent and lighter showers during the short rainy season. <br /> We consider July through October to <strong>be the best time to visit Watamu,</strong> as this is the longest dry season with cool coastal conditions and the skies are clear and sunny, but Watamu is a beautiful coastal destination no matter when you visit. The second dry and humid season is much shorter and lasts from January to February and early parts of March. The Indian Ocean coastline tends to be more humid that inland areas and average annual temperatures are generally in the lower to mid-80s degrees Fahrenheit (26-30 Celsius) during the day and lower to mid-70s degrees Fahrenheit (21-24 Celsius) at night. January to March are the warmest months, with daytime temperatures in the lower 90&rsquo;s Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) and the coolest months are July and August with average temperatures in the lower-80s Fahrenheit (27 Celsius) during the day.

                        <strong>Watamu</strong> <strong>Nightlife</strong> is amazing with many <strong>Watamu Bars</strong> and<strong> Watamu Clubs</strong> to look for, there are many <strong>clubs in Watamu</strong> where most of the locals and tourists go for parties and fun, the expats and backpackers often look for international <strong>Watamu Clubs, </strong>here is no reason to be afraid to go out of the beach resort at night for visiting <strong>bars in Diani,</strong> for security take a taxi from the <strong>Watamu beach hotels</strong> and back, not Tuktuk or motorcycle, every <strong>bar in Watamu</strong> will call a reliable <strong>Watamu taxi</strong> to bring you back after dinner. All <strong>bars in Watamu</strong> serve decent food and there are a lot of small good restaurants. In many <strong>Watamu restaurants</strong> it can take an hour from ordering until food is served, as everything is prepared freshly.<strong> Night live in Watamu Beach</strong> is comparable to <strong>Mombasa</strong> or <strong>Mtwapa.</strong> If you want to go back to the hotel at night, you should always order a <strong>taxi in Watamu</strong> or let the <strong>club in Watamu</strong> do it for you. Every <strong>Watamu</strong> club not the ladies in the club knows trustworthy drivers. Furthermore, it is not advisable to wait in the street until a tuktuk or taxi comes by accidentally. Always wait directly at the hotel/bar/restaurant until the ordered vehicle pulls up. The "motorcycle guys" along <strong>Watamu</strong> Beach Road who do snatch thefts are incredibly fast. At the weekend, many people go to the <strong>Watamu Manyatta</strong> around 8:00 p.m. (first outside - later inside) and around midnight they go to the Tandoori until the sun rises. On Fridays there are often parties in Soul Breeze, right on the beach (more electro) and on Saturdays in Backpackers. Diani offers so many opportunities to find a <strong>Watamu girl</strong> for cheap <strong>sex in Watamu</strong> And around every corner in Diani center, it&rsquo;s highly likely you&rsquo;ll run into <strong>Watamu hookers</strong> or <strong>Watamu prostitutes</strong> ready to jump on you with open arms, you&rsquo;ll find <strong>escort girls</strong> or call girls in <strong>Watamu bars</strong>, or Diani massage parlors, Diani nightclubs and even online, Diani Girls might approach you, but you can sit alone and choose or move on at will. It&rsquo;s a good idea to get to know a <strong>Watamu prostitute</strong> to be sure you enjoy the company of the one you eventually take home. The hookers in Diani will happily <strong>party with you</strong>, if you buy them drinks
